## My Decision for 2026

**Primary Stack:**
- **Architecture Discussions:** Claude 3.5 (Web - Free)
- **Daily Coding:** Cursor IDE (Free tier to start)
- **Code Completion:** Cursor's built-in or Copilot if available

**Reasoning:** This gives me Claude's superior architectural reasoning 
combined with Cursor's codebase-aware coding assistance.

**Cost:** $0 to start, $20/month later if needed
