### Brain Dump
This week was the start of the new process being used. It started well, but eventually I got tired and overwhelmed with too much information and felt drowned with tasks.
Keeping tabs with Whatsapp groups took a toll on me mentally, and resulted in a burne out feeling.
I managed to work a few days on my side projects, although after Thursday I abandoned it, also spent little time every evening given the low energy level. I want to find more time so I can spend on it, it was a good beggining though. It is time to keep the ball rolling and not give up.
Free time was also a burden sometimes because I tried to fill it with social media and poker which make me feel tired afterwards.
this week was challenging because of the car that was broken and I had to manage to fix it while working, exercising and driving the family around.
